Analysis of bike share system usage

The project is made for 'plug-&-play' analysis of bike share system, which convinietly sorts and orders raw data received from bike share data sensors. All results are to be exported into .xlsx files to be further analysed by bike share company's employees, which can also be used with third-party software, for example using flowmap.blue to create interactive flow map (https://flowmap.blue/1YpAioGWGFETQqMNBwUSit82XRRPG7nnSvaXIjHQpHzs/a181a60?v=51.137889%2C71.428134%2C11.26%2C0%2C0&a=0&as=1&b=1&bo=75&c=0&ca=1&d=0&fe=1&lt=1&lfm=ALL&col=TealGrn&f=50)
All primary data has been obtained from bike share system administrator.
